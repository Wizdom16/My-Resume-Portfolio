            <p>Inventory Specilist</p>
            <ul><p>Issues Addressed:</p>
                <li>Too Much Stock:

                    Found too many products taking up space and costing too much money to store.
                    Some products weren't selling well.</li>
                <li>Adding and Sorting Products:

                    Noticed that product information was all over the place, making it hard for customers to find what they wanted.
                    </li>
                    <ul><p>Approach:</p>
                        <li>Reducing Excess Stock:

                            Looked at past sales and what people were buying to figure out what was selling slowly.
                            Worked with the sales and buying teams to decide how much of each product to keep.
                            Used a new system to track how much of each product was left and when to get more.
                            Adding and Sorting Products:
                            
                            Made all product information the same so customers could easily understand what they were looking at.
                            Sorted products into categories so customers could find things easily.
                            Results:</li>
                        <li>Reducing Excess Stock:

                            Got rid of 30% of the extra stock in the first three months.
                            Saved 25% on storage costs.
                            Sold products faster, so there was less risk they wouldn't sell at all.</li>
                        <li>Adding and Sorting Products:

                            Made it easier for customers to find and understand products on the website.
                            Customers were happier and bought more things because it was easier for them to find what they wanted.
                            These changes made things run better and cost less for 9eleven Wears.</li>
